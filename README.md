# BEProject_ragaranjini for bestenlist2020 python internship
Main Project : OCR (Open ‘projectOCR.py’ for codes , and ‘OCR project output.pdf’ to view output)

Analysis of ‘tesseract’ played a vital role in my final project since it is the reference given .With this analysis , I was able to learn that tesseract is an optical character recognition engine and more about its usage . I got to learn and also used the concept of ‘file handling’ in my project to implement the applications of tesseract .

I got to have hands on experience on: Python language

Thank You Best Enlist :)
