# OCR - Optical Character Recognition
Project : OCR (Open ‘projectOCR.py’ for codes , and ‘OCR project output.pdf’ to view output)

Analysis of ‘tesseract’ played a vital role in this project . With this analysis , I was able to learn that tesseract is an optical character recognition engine and more about its usage . I got to learn and also used the concept of ‘file handling’ in my project to implement the applications of tesseract .

Implementation : Converts an image into PDF .
